# symfony-app
A basic PHP app built with symfony. A showcase of symfony's authentication, templating and database concepts.

# To see how it works:
1. Ensure you have Symfony installed. If you don't see [here](https://symfony.com/download)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open up your favourite terminal and `cd` into the project directory
4. Run `symfony serve`, and your application is now live on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/]. But don't run it just yet.
5. To have this application work properly, you will need to setup a database connection in the `.env.local`
6. Now you can visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/] to see the application live!
